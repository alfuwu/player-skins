# player skins
This mod reimplements modern Minecraft skins into Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. It also (configurably) supports slim player models, capes, and the second skin layer present in modern Minecraft versions.

It replaces some functionality of Minecraft, so there is definitely a possibility that this mod conflicts with another (specifically, if the other mod completely changes the player model). However, if you're using a mod like that, you probably don't need this mod anyways.
